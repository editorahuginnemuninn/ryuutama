# Ryuutama
Ryuutama System for Foundry VTT

# Support and 0.8.X
I am currently not able to update this project to be compatible with 0.8.X. I am unable to dedicate the time needed to review every breaking change and potentially rewrite this entire project. I know that maybe disappointing, but the reality is, projects like this are hobbies and support for them does not put food on the table for my family.

# Some notes
I am still in the process of finalizing some of the compendiums. Most things do not have icons/art for them, and use the default icon.
Tutorials on how to use the system will come at a later time. They are in the process of being written and will be included in the wiki section when complete.
